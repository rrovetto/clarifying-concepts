## Example of presupposed meaning, and ommitted possibilities
by Robert J. Rovetto
This example is related to my ontology 101 project, which partially spotlights areas for improving comprehension about the concepts in abstract modeling such as ontology, conceptual data modeling, etc.
It shows how communications and writing assumes a certain distinction, meaning or paradigm for a given term or concept, such as those of entity, property, relation.

### Example 1
We read: 
- "What ontologies in both information science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities, including both objects and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories."
(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science) - 15  may 2024)

Although a good basic overview, if the terms are undefined (as in this case), statements like this presuppose some meaning of 'entities', and various distinctions, such as properties and relations. 
Afterall--we can ask: Why distinguish entity from property and relation? and Are the latter examples of the former? (If not, then why?)

If the above quoted sentence is using those undefined terms in an intuitive, colloquial and natural-speech way, then it alleviates my concern a bit, but not much because in everyday communication, 'entity' is not common.

Perhaps the presupposed understanding is that of [ER-modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model), and it's sense of 'entity':
- "An entity may be defined as a thing that is capable of an independent existence that can be uniquely identified, and is capable of storing data.[5] An entity is an abstraction from the complexities of a domain. When we speak of an entity, we normally speak of some aspect of the real world that can be distinguished from other aspects of the real world.[6]"

[6]Beynon-Davies, Paul (2004). Database Systems. Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave: Houndmills. ISBN 978-1403916013.

But that presupposition should be stated. It should be stated because, without qualification, one can validly consider objects, events, properties, and relations as entities because the concept and term 'entity' is arguably maximally broad.
Additionally, although some may also presuppose the philosophical problem of Bradleys regress about relations, it should not necessarily be assumed because the regress can be prevented or curtailed, and we can model both relation categories and relation instances.

Perhaps the sentence presupposes either or both of the following senses: 
- "1 a : BEING, EXISTENCE;  especially   : independent, separate, or self-contained existence  b : the existence of a thing as contrasted with its attributes
  2 : something that has separate and distinct existence and objective or conceptual reality
  3 : an organization (as a business or governmental unit) that has an identity separate from those of its members" (merriam websters 11th collegiate dictionary)

- https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/entity

Some of these sense of 'entity' would more closely allign with the concept of instances. But a vagueness persists because we can model and speak of properties and relations of both instances and their categories,.

#### The take-aways, here, is this: 
- some communications about these topics presuppose a sense of the terms they mention. that must be unpacked; otherwise confusion can abound. some may not define their terms, causing the same.
- some communications--in mentioning these things (entities, properties, relations)--may ignore or exclude modeling options whereby the distinctions made in the communication do not hold or vary. 
in other words, assumptions, ignored or missing possibiltiies, are often found in communications about abstract modeling such as conceptual modeling, ontology, semantic web, AI, etc.
